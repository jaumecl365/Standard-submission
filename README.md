Project Analysis, Information Architecture
The page's design follows a clear hierarchical structure, prioritizing accessibility and ease of navigation. Information is divided into well-defined sections such as "Contact", "Profile", "Professional Experience", "Education", "Languages", "Skills", and "Interests". Each section is clearly identified with highlighted headers and well-organized within a central container. This structure helps users quickly locate the information they need.

Additionally, a responsive design has been implemented using flexbox in CSS, ensuring the page adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to larger screens. The sections are designed to take up uniform space and adjust automatically, providing an optimal user experience. A sidebar for the profile photo has also been incorporated, offering a visually appealing presentation by highlighting the CV owner.


Project Analysis, Visual Design
In the visual design, decisions were made to create a professional, modern, and accessible appearance. The color palette combines neutral tones, such as the white background and light gray, with accents in dark blue (#2c3e50) for headings, which add a touch of professionalism. Texts use the Arial font, ensuring readability on devices of all sizes.

The use of generous margins and proper spacing between sections contributes to a clean and organized appearance. Additionally, a card-like design is applied to sections, with rounded corners and subtle shadows that add depth without overwhelming the interface. The profile photo is outlined with a dark blue border, creating a focal point on the page that humanizes the content.
